Today we’ll talk about the core differences between Angular and React.</p>\n<h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>\n<p>Ok, we all know that Angular and React are two different things. Angular is a full fledged framework that ships all you need to build a full modern web app, while React is <em>“a JavaScript library for building user interfaces”</em>.</p>\n<p>Since React is <strong>just</strong> a library (and awesome by the way), when you’re using React to create a new web app, you need to adhere to a set of libraries for http requests, better state management and so on. Thus when refering to React, please remember that I’m refering to the ecosystem not just the library. :)</p>\n<h2>The Angular way: DI and Services</h2>\n<p>Just as its predecessor (angularjs), Angular comes with Dependency Injection so we can inject Services into our components, and that enables the basic state management that we see as soon as we first use Angular.</p>\n<p>Do acomplish that we firstly create our service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This however showed weasel</li>\n<li>\n<p>Well uncritical so misled</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this is very interesting</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Goodness much until that fluid owl</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When she reached the first hills of the <strong>Italic Mountains</strong>, she had a last\nview back on the skyline of her hometown <em>Bookmarksgrove</em>, the headline of\n<a href=\"http://google.com\">Alphabet Village</a> and the subline of her own road, the Line\nLane.
