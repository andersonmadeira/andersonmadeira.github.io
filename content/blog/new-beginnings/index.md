description: This article compares Angular and React ecosystems exposing how the two manage state and data flow in a modern web application.

With a flood of frontend frameworks and libraries of today, some remain on stage for the fight. Today we'll talk about the core differences between Angular and React.

## A Brief Introduction

Ok, we all know that Angular and React are two different things. Angular is a full fledged framework that ships all you need to build a full modern web app, while React is _"a JavaScript library for building user interfaces"_.

Since React is **just** a library (and awesome by the way), when you're using React to create a new web app, you need to adhere to a set of libraries for http requests, better state management and so on. Thus when refering to React, please remember that I'm refering to the ecosystem not just the library. :)

## The Angular way: DI and Services

Just as its predecessor (angularjs), Angular comes with Dependency Injection so we can inject Services into our components, and that enables the basic state management that we see as soon as we first use Angular.

Do acomplish that we firstly create our service:

view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

#### Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in
which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

###### Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it
